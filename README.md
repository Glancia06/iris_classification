# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION PROJECT

### Project:Iris flower classification using Machine Learning

Machine Learning in python:

Machine learning is is the kind of programming which gives computers the capability to automatically learn from data without being explicitly programmed. This means in other words that these programs change their behaviour by learning from data.Machine learning as a very likely approach to achieve human-computer integration and can be applied
in many computer fields. Machine learning is not a typical method as it contains many different computer algorithms. Different algorithms aim to solve different machine learning tasks. At last, all the algorithms can help the computer to act more like a human. Machine learning is already applied in many fields, for instance, pattern recognition, Artificial Intelligence, computer vision, data mining, text categorization and so on. Machine learning gives a new way to develop the intelligence of the machines. It also becomes an easier way to help people to analyse data from huge data sets.
Following are the steps involved in creating a well-defined ML project:

Understand and define the problem
Analyse and prepare the data
Apply the algorithms
Reduce the errors
Predict the result


## IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFACTION


The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres):

Length of the sepals

Width of the sepals

Length of the petals

Width of the petals.

The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) from measurements of sepals and petals' length and width.

This Repository contains the Iris Dataset Project created by using 6 different Machine Learning Algorithms.

Classification Algorithms used:

Logistic Regression (LR)

Super Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

Random Forest 

Naive Bayes
